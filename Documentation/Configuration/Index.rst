Configuration Reference
=======================

You find the mind-map-descriptin of the configuration-array in the folder */typo3conf/ext/horny_shit/Documentation/Appendix/Configuration.mm*.

You will find examples in the plugin of the extension. You can activate the plugin
via the configuration constant. You find a link to the configuration in the extensionmanager.
The plugin-text explain in german language, how to read the mind-map and how to use the *svt*-viewhelper.

Remark
------
You find the two icons 'ext_icon_smart.svg' and 'ext_icon_original.svg' in the folder Resources/Icons. Many people don't
like my  construction-worker-humor, so I present in the initial version of horny_shit only a soft icon. If you have
humor, you can override the the file 'ext_icon.svg' with the content of 'ext_icon_original.svg' having fun. :-)
